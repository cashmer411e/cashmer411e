Ohio’s Fairness in Lending Act of 2018 requires lenders to give borrowers sufficient time to repay in equal installments, with payments taking up only a small share of borrowers’ paychecks.15 Under the act, any loan issued in violation of state law, whether originating online or in stores, is null, void, and uncollectible, and the attorney general is empowered to enforce this provision.

In Colorado similar reforms, enacted in 2010, yielded commensurate results, with lower prices, affordable payments, and reasonable times to repay.16 Stores in the state doubled their efficiency, to about 1,100 unique borrowers per year.

Borrowers in these and other states with sensible small-lending laws have not turned in great numbers to unlicensed lenders.

With prudent reforms like those in Ohio and Colorado, Virginia policymakers can reduce costs for their constituents, creating affordability for borrowers and a viable market for lenders, including lower-cost providers that currently avoid operating in the state because of its outdated laws,19 and saving families more than $100 million annually.
